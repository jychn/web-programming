Description:
    The project is a proxy web server, named Xeloxy, developed for an alien that
    is unable to access Earth-based websites due to Earth's firewall
    restrictions. The server acts as an intermediary allowing a user to access
    different files via the CURL command, including both local server files and
    remote server files when given a hostname/URL. It is able to access HTML,
    MP3, and JPEG files, and it is also able to execute both local and remote
    CGI programs, returning the output to the user.

Questions:
    1. What happens if your random number generator picks a port number that a
    student already has allocated? Be specific, maybe even include an error
    message....
        - Due to TCP, the server would be unable to listen on the randomly
        generated port since it is already in use. {insert specific example}

    2. What happens if your random number generator is incorrect and returns a
    number below 1024?  Again, be specific.
        - {Ports below 1024 are reserved for system admin processes, but test
        this on the CS server to get a more specific answer.}

    3. Why, in a real world deployment with multiple, unknown users, would it be
    not very useful to use a random port for your server?
        - It is unknown whether other processes or users have already allocated
        the randomly generated port, thus creating the possibility of the
        server being unsuccessful since the port is already in use.

    4. When I add [".foo", "test/foo"] to the extAllowed array, what (if any)
    lines of code do you need to modify/add in your program?
        - No lines of code need to be added since the extAllowed array is
        called on by forEach() which acts on each element of the array (with an
        anonymous function) regardless of the number of elements.
