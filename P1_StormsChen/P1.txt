        - To understand cgi and html file integration

Description:
    The project consists of a intergalactic currency exchange program that is
    able to convert one currency value to another given two specified currencies
    from a list of both alien and human (or terran) currencies, and a specified
    amount to be converted. The program also offers the ability to identify the
    usdollar values of specific terran or alien commodities.

Questions:
    1. What does your CGI do if the value for exchange has the same currencies
    for in and out?
        - Our CGI maintains the value of the currency.

    2. What is an example curl command to produce an answer? What answer did you
    receive? Specifically, describe what you see from the output.
        - An example curl command is
        "curl https://www.cs.uky.edu/~wjst225/galactic_exchange.cgi?incurrency=usdollar&outcurrency=euro&amount=5&convert_button=Please+Convert"
        and it displays the output of cgi given the form values from the url,
        including all html code that is printed.

    3. What happens if one of the field values submitted is a string of 100
    characters? 1000 characters? 10000 characters?
        - The default field length of each field is 20 characters, so any number
        of characters beyond that cannot be submitted.

    4. If you were given 50 new currency conversion factors for all the worlds
    using the CGI, approximately how many lines of code would you need to add to
    your program?
        - 50 more lines would need to be added, since all conversion factors are
        stored in a dictionary.

    5. If you were given 100 new commodities, how many lines of code would need
    to be added?
        - 100 more lines would need to be added, since all commodity values
        are stored in a dictionary.
